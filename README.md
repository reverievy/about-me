# about-me
Hi! Glad to see you here 😊 

I’m Ivy, a Marketing and Business Analytics student at Drexel University. I thrive where data meets storytelling, blending a human-centric approach with analytical rigor to uncover insights that drive impact in an ever-changing digital landscape.

My journey began in social media management and paid media advertising, but my curiosity quickly extended beyond launching campaigns to uncovering the story behind their performance. Having solved analytics challenges across e-commerce, fashion retail, and media agency environments, I’m excited to keep growing at the intersection of marketing and analytics!

When I’m not staring at numbers up and down, I play the ukulele 🎶, make fun little lattes 🍵, and run along the Schuylkill River Bank 🏃🏻‍♀️
